        <h1>Queensland's Geological Features API</h1>
        <p>This is an API that delivers information about specific geological (sometimes "geologic") features within the Australian state of Queensland. The data is sourced from the <a href="https://github.com/geological-survey-of-queensland/qldgeofeatures-dataset">Qld GeoFeatures Dataset</a>. That data is formulated according to the <a href="http://linked.data.gov.au/def/geofeatures">GeoFeatures Ontology</a> which is a profile of the <a href="https://locationindex.org">Location Index (LocI)</a> project's ontology. This means Qld GeoFeatures data is conformant with the LocI project requirements.</p>
